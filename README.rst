Python Mattermost Driver (APIv4)
================================

Info
----

The repository will try to keep up with the master of https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-api-reference

If something changes, it is most likely to change because the official mattermost api changed.

Python 3.4 or later is required.

Installation
------------

.. inclusion-marker-start-install

``pip install mattermostdriver``

.. inclusion-marker-end-install

Documentation
-------------
Documentation can be found at https://vaelor.github.io/python-mattermost-driver/ .

Usage
-----

.. inclusion-marker-start-usage

.. code:: python

    foo = Driver({
        """
        Required options

        Instead of the login/password, you can also use a personal access token.
        If you have a token, you don't need to pass login/pass.

        """
        Optional options

        These options already have useful defaults or are just not needed in every case.
        In most cases, you won't need to modify these, especially the basepath.
        If you can only use a self signed/insecure certificate, you should set
        verify to False. Please double check this if you have any errors while
        using a self signed certificate!

        If for some reasons you get regular timeouts after a while, try to decrease
        this value. The websocket will ping the server in this interval to keep the connection
        alive.

        there.

        Setting debug to True, will activate a very verbose logging.
        This also activates the logging for the requests package,
        so you can see every request you send.

        Be careful. This SHOULD NOT be active in production, because this logs a lot!
        Even the password for your account when doing driver.login()!

    """
    Most of the requests need you to be logged in, so calling login()
    should be the first thing you do after you created your Driver instance.
    login() returns the raw response.
    If using a personal access token, you still need to run login().
    In this case, does not make a login request, but a `get_user('me')`
    and sets everything up in the client.

    You can make api calls by using calling `Driver.endpointofchoice`.
    Using api[''] is deprecated for 5.0.0!

    So, for example, if you used `Driver.api['users'].get_user('me')` before,
    you now just do `Driver.users.get_user('me')`.
    The names of the endpoints and requests are almost identical to
    the names on the api.mattermost.com/v4 page.
    API calls always return the json the server send as a response.

    you can pass them to the function in the following way:
